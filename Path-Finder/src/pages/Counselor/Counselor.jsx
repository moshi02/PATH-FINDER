      Trees are woody perennial plants that are a member of the kingdom{" "}
      <em>Plantae</em>. All species of trees are grouped by their genus, family,
      and order. This helps make identifying and studying trees easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from providing oxygen for the planet and beauty when they bloom or
      turn color, trees are very useful. Certain species of hardwood and
      softwood trees are excellent for timber, making furniture, and paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      When managed properly, trees are a good source of renewable energy and
      construction material.
